turning towards the past now    
burning from the ash of intention
shadows of what i know

    turning for the light now
    look into the night for direction
    watch over me eyes closed

things are worsening
and none of us are passive in it
need to turn to something
that might break our fall this time

i’m sinking

                        don’t know what i’ve been thinking

    need the keys to

  lay it on me
  so many chances
  why don’t we just start a fight
  to make an advancement
  i wish this could come out right
something’s holding me
maybe you can see it
			caught in plaster
			moulding
			fasten 
					     i could spend a morning listening to three things
					 we could let this all roll over with the seasons
					i can see the walls all crumble with your reasons
oh
something wasn’t right
saw this other night
thought that this was over
why should i be right
thought that i could show you 
that this wouldn’t hold on me but
			 i don’t know what
			i was thinking

					     i could spend a morning listening to reason
					 we could let this all go why should i repeat things
					  we could let the walls all crumble with the seasons


		
	 i forget where this started from
	but i turned out like you thought i would
				and i forget what you thought it was
				 but we turned out like you saw it should
		and i forget what we said it would
		 but we turned out like we thought it was	
	   and we forget where this started from	
	    but i turned out like you saw i would

i wait to see what’s left
your shadow crossed the stair now and you’re gone
    i will not be here for too long

retell me how it went
these older rhythms dancing in my blood
                                                            there is

    i will find the feet i will
        i will climb beneath i will
    i will find a peace i will i will 
                        i will

                this morning i was there
            your candle colored hair awaits the wind
        above this sun reflective skin

        i’ve got it under my skin again
            this lifting taking a hold on me
            as we go rolling and tumbling 

                    i’m falling out of my skin again
                this drifting taking its toll on me
                        as we go rolling and tumbling

why don’t you go melt
    somewhere else
i’m stuck listening to my
        middle finger cuz it feels just like
                        wrapping paper

    i heard it overhead
    harsh, repeating
    and when i turned my head
    saw her bleeding
    i turn, i turn again
    from the corner
    this war is overhead
    under cover

        i’ve been blind
        i know it
        in my life
        to all this
        sheltered in white
        this violence
        right before my eyes
        you know this
        we’ve got no right
        to own this
            land we occupy is stolen
                when are we to 
                open up our eyes
            and notice
                our hands denying
                    chains they’re holding
                even while we
                say we’re in this fight
        we owe this
        to those lives
        we’ve stolen

turn yourself inside and turn around again
round again and 
sifting through these clouds and turn
inside again
turn yourself inside again

    willfully departed listen
    how can i abandon all this
    living in established basements
    hoping not to become something
    i could live forever under
    tranquil as the softest steamboat
    heard but never quite remembered
    sink into established systems
    sinking on the crest of a wave
    water whispers to the ocean
    crossing over ancient islands
    wash away the pain with violence
    staring at the open counter
    i can see his hands are shaking
    when they boil over tearing
    she remains within them faceless
    how can i abandon all this
    living in this broken building
    broken from the cracked foundation
    never seen a day without it
    signs imprinted on white paper
    lies and myths establish systems
    then they boil over firing
    bullets over generations

    willfully departed listen
    how can i abandon all this
    when they boil over firing
    bullets over generations

    how can i abandon all this
    living through established systems
    when they boil over firing
    bullets every generation

    willfully departed listen
    how can i abandon all this
    when they boil over firing
    bullets over generations

    how can i abandon all this
    living through established systems
    when they boil over firing
    bullets every generation
